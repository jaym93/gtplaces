				 Zend Server 5.0
				=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-


What is Zend Server?
====================
Zend Server is a complete, enterprise-ready Web Application Server for running
and managing PHP applications that require a high level of reliability,
performance and security. 

Zend Server Community Edition (CE) is a simple, integrated Web Application
Server for building and running non-critical PHP applications. 

Installation Path:
==================
By default, Zend Server is installed in /usr/local/zend, (will be referred to
as <install_path>).

Generic Tarball Installation:
=============================
An alternative location to the above path can be specified by the installer. 
After the installation, the document root of the bundled Apache is set to
<install_path>/apache2/htdocs which can be accessed through the URL
http://localhost:10088/. 

Apache listens to port 10088 by default, to avoid conflicts. This can be
changed by editing the Apache configuration file and restarting the Apache
daemon. The Apache configuration file is located at:
<install_path>/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

DEB and RPM Installations:
==========================
Zend Server will be installed in <install_path>.
The installation will use the Apache package provided by your distribution. As
such, the default web server URL and document root path might change on
different Linux distributions. Normally, the default web server will be
accessible through http://localhost/ and the document root will be somewhere
under /var/www.

What is Installed?
==================
Zend Server provides a complete PHP stack that can be controlled by the
Administration Interface. 
In addition to PHP and Apache, the following components are installed:

Zend components that are installed and enabled:

 - Zend Debugger - The Zend Debugger component enables remote debugging        
   of PHP scripts using Zend Studio.
	
 - Zend Optimizer+ - The Zend Optimizer+ component speeds up PHP execution
   through opcode caching and optimization.
	
 - Zend Data Cache - The Zend Data Cache component provides a set of PHP       
   functions for improving performance by storing data in the cache.

 - Zend Framework - An open source framework for developing Web applications 
   and Web services with PHP.

 - PHPmyAdmin - A popular open-source management tool for handling MySql 
   Database over a Web interface.

Additional Zend Server features that are not included in the Community
Edition:

 - Zend Monitor - The Zend Monitor component is integrated into the runtime
   environment and serves as an alerting and collection mechanism for early
   detection of PHP script problems.

 - Zend Download Server (ZDS) - The ZDS (Zend Download Server) component    
   improves Apache's scalability by taking over static content downloads and
   passing them to a dedicated process optimized for parallel downloads (not
   supported in Microsoft Windows and IBMi).

 - Zend Page Cache - The Zend Page Cache component is used for caching         
   the entire output of PHP scripts without changing the PHP code.

 - Job Queue Component - The Jobs Component is used to streamline offline 
   processing of PHP scripts.

 - Zend Code Tracing - Code Tracing enables real-time execution flow recording
   in Production Environments.

 - Cluster Management - Scales environments to a cluster (not
   supported in IBMi).
        
Zend components that are installed but not enabled by default in the Tarball
installation and are additional in the DEB and RPM Installations:

 - Zend Java Bridge - The Java Bridge provides the ability to
   use Java classes and code from within PHP.
	
 - Zend Guard Loader - The Zend Guard Loader is used in order to run PHP       
   scripts that were encoded with Zend Guard.

Zend Server for IBMi also includes:

 - Zend 5250 Bridge - The Zend 5250 Bridge component is used to access 5250 
   Interactive programs screens.
   Note: One interactive session can be accessed without valid Zend Server license

 - Zend 5250 Emulator - The Zend 5250 Emulator provides browser access to i/OS 
   resources and applications equivalent to an IBM© 5250 terminal without having 
   to deploy telnet or terminal client applications

 - Zend 5250 Bridge Demo Applications - demonstrate how the Zend 5250 Bridge API 
   can be used to create interactive web-applications for 5250 programs. 
   Clicking one of the demo application links open a new browser Window.

 - Zend Navigator Demo Applications - The Zend Navigator Demo Application 
   demonstrates the usage of the PHP toolkit for IBM i functions.

Basic Usage
===========
The Administration Interface provides the various controllers for configuring
and managing your environment. The first thing you should do after completing
the installation process is to launch the Administration interface and set your
password.
Additional actions that may need to be done from the command line are Start /
Stop actions for your Apache Web Server and the Administration Interface
dedicated Web Server:

* Note: You must have root privileges to perform these actions.

To start/stop Apache run the following command:
<install_path>/bin/zendctl.sh <start-apache | stop-apache | restart-apache>

To start/stop The Administration Interface's dedicated Web Server run the
following command:
<install_path>/bin/zendctl.sh <stop-lighttpd | start-lighttpd |
restart-lighttpd>

The Administration Web Interface can be accessed from your browser at
http://localhost:10081 or https://localhost:10082. If you are trying to access
a remote server replace localhost with the address of the server you are 
accessing.

How to Use/Run the Zend Controller
==================================
The Zend Controller GUI provides quick access to frequently performed tasks and
useful information.
The Zend controller can be launched from:
<install_path>/bin/zendcontroller. Once launched, it is available from the 
system tray.
Right-Click on the icon to open the setup menu for changing the IP address and
password configurations.
